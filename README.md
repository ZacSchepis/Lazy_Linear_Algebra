This is my repo for any random projects that I feel like doing. Nothing much is in this at this moment besides one thing

This should in theory also work with Google Chrome (no promises) but I made this with having Microsoft Edge in mind instead.
It works on my windows 11 laptop, I made a part that might work with Linux too but I have not tested that as I don't have a device using
a Linux OS with a GUI so that part is likely hit or miss.
You shouldn't have to change anything too much on this, except before running it, you should:
1. Open MS Edge
2. Press ctrl+shift+i
3. Ensure that "Toggle Device Emulation" (it looks like a phone and tablet) is enabled, it will be blue or any colour that isn't greyed out.
4. If it isn't: you can press ctrl+shift+m to toggle it on/off or you can just click its icon

If you want to try this on a different browser app, change the "app_name" variable to that app. It might be the app name in all caps
