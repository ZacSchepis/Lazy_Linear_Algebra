This is my repo for any random projects that I feel like doing. Nothing much is in this at this moment besides one thing

### Lazy Linear Algebra
This side project I felt like working on to get a slightly better understanding of Linear Algebra after taking it this semester. It is not fully operational yet because the code to compute the determinant of an n x n matrix is not 100% perfect, but hey, good news; if you pass in only 3x3 matrices to it, it should work smoothly! 
Downloading this folder and loading the index.html file in a browser will allow you to use some of these tools, or just loading the [github.io](https://zacschepis.github.io/Random-Projects/) will work too to use those features without downloading anything. 
If you want to just use this in your text editor, in Eigen.js, there is an object named "Demonstrate" that has various tools to show how to use those operations; and also in "ProblemTypes.js" is an object named "Problems" which will have some other Linear Algebra related problems.

### Daily Searches:
This should in theory also work with Google Chrome (no promises) but I made this with having Microsoft Edge in mind instead.
It works on my windows 11 laptop, I made a part that might work with Linux too but I have not tested that as I don't have a device using
a Linux OS with a GUI so that part is likely hit or miss.
You shouldn't have to change anything too much on this, except before running it, you should:
1. Open MS Edge
2. Press ctrl+shift+i
3. Ensure that "Toggle Device Emulation" (it looks like a phone and tablet) is enabled, it will be blue or any colour that isn't greyed out.
4. If it isn't: you can press ctrl+shift+m to toggle it on/off or you can just click its icon

If you want to try this on a different browser app, change the "app_name" variable to that app. It might be the app name in all caps
