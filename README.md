This is my repo for any random projects that I feel like doing. Nothing much is in this at this moment besides one thing

### Lazy Linear Algebra
This side project I felt like working on to get a slightly better understanding of Linear Algebra after taking it this semester. It is not fully operational yet because the code to compute the determinant of an n x n matrix is not 100% perfect, but hey, good news; if you pass in only 3x3 matrices to it, it should work smoothly! 
Downloading this folder and loading the index.html file in a browser will allow you to use some of these tools, or just loading the [github.io](https://zacschepis.github.io/Random-Projects/) will work too to use those features without downloading anything. 
If you want to just use this in your text editor, in Eigen.js, there is an object named "Demonstrate" that has various tools to show how to use those operations; and also in "ProblemTypes.js" is an object named "Problems" which will have some other Linear Algebra related problems.
